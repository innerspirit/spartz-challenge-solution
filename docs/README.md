# Spartz Coding Challenge

## Build A Simple REST API

We have included a set of sample data in `cities.csv` and `users.csv`. Please implement a few basic operations on the data provided, including listing the cities in a given state, listing cities near another city, and registering a visit to a particular city by a user.  You may use whatever language or tools you wish to complete the exercise.  Keep in mind that you may be asked to extend your solution in an on-site interview.

**Required endpoints**

1. List all cities in a state

	`GET /v1/states/{state}/cities`
 
2. List cities within a 100 mile radius of a city

	`GET /v1/states/{state}/cities/{city}?radius=100`
 
3. Allow a user to update a row of data to indicate they have visited a particular city.

	`POST /v1/users/{user}/visits`

	```
	{
		"city": "Chicago",
		"state": "IL"
	}
	```

4. Return a list of cities the user has visited

	`GET /v1/users/{user}/visits`

## Things To Consider

- How to deal with bad requests
- Requests that could result in large data sets


## Deliverables

- The source code for your solution.
- The database schema you use to implement your solution.
- Any additional documentation you feel is necessary to explain how your application works, or describe your thought process and design decisions.
